title: Catchment Polygon Processing

##Background##

The Catchment Polygon Processing Tool converts the Catchment Grid into a polygon vector.  This means that you will be able to select individual catchment polygons, just like you selected individual reaches of the NHD stream.

##Steps##

1. Go to Terrain Preprocessing &#8594; Catchment Polygon Processing &#8594; Click OK

Now we can select each catchment using the <a href="/pictures/SelectFeaturesIcon.png"><img src="/pictures/SelectFeaturesIcon.png"></a>  icon as the catchments are in vector polygon format rather than a raster.
