##Installation and Access##

GIS is available on many computers throughout campus; however, you may prefer to use the ones in either Y2E2 184 or Branner Library, because these will also have the required ArcHydro extension.  

You are also free to use your own computer if you install the 1-year ArcEditor license. This license is available for Stanford computers [here](https://lib.stanford.edu/stanford-geospatial-center/arcgis-102-software-download). If you are running ArcGIS on your personal laptop, make sure that you have several GB of space available and preferably 8GB (or more) of RAM.

The ArcHydro extension is free and available [here](http://resources.arcgis.com/en/communities/hydro/01vn00000010000000.htm). Make sure to use the ArcHydro Tools 2.0 version for this assignment.

##Programs in ArcGIS Suite##

### ArcMap###

ArcMap is the main component of Esri's ArcGIS suite of geospatial processing programs, and is used primarily to view, edit, create, and analyze geospatial data.

### ArcCatalog###

ArcCatalog is similar to Windows Explorer for managing ArcGIS data.  Because layers (e.g., shapefiles and rasters) often consist of many different files it is always best to use ArcCatalog when moving or renaming files.  You can use ArcCatalog to preview data.  You can also run ArcToolbox from within ArcCatalog.
