title: Creating Professional Looking Maps
---

It is now time to learn the basics of making professional-looking maps, which can be included in reports and presentations. It is good cartographic practice to include a title, legend, north arrow, and scale bar on all maps. You will also see how to line up map elements, how to modify the page setup, and how to add a small locator map.

1. Click the Layout View icon in the bottom left corner <a href="/pictures/LayoutView.png"><img src="/pictures/LayoutView.png"></a> .

2,All three data frames should appear in the layout view. Select and delete the unnecessary data frame (“Layers”). Use the Layout toolbar to navigate and zoom in and out, when in the Layout View. You can still change the zoom level of each map by using the data zoom buttons. 

Note: The Layout Zoom <a href="/pictures/LayoutZoom.png"><img src="/pictures/LayoutZoom.png"></a>  is different than the regular Zoom <a href="/pictures/ZoomIn.png"><img src="/pictures/ZoomIn.png"></a> .

3.Change the page setup to the appropriate paper size.

Go to File &#8594; Page and Print Setup. Under Paper: Size, use the down arrow to the right of the default Letter paper size and scroll up or down to the size you want. You can also choose Custom from the menu to specify a non-standard page size. Click OK.

4.Grids and Guides can be useful for lining up maps, legends, text, and other features to ensure that your whole layout looks tidy and professional. In Layout view, right-click in the white area outside the map you are working on, and select Grids &#8594; Snap to Grid and Grids &#8594; Grid (so you can see the grids). You can specify additional settings, such as the grid spacing and units by right-clicking again and selecting ArcMap Options. Browse through the tabs to see the different options that are available.

5.Resize the two maps on the page so the main image is large and the locator map is smaller. Then right-click on the locator map and select Properties. Go to the Extent Indicator tab. Choose the data frame of your clipped DEM and use the right-arrow to move it to the right under “Show extent indicators for these data frames” box. 

6.Go to Insert &#8594; Title. Enter a title. You can double-click the title to edit. 

7.o to Insert &#8594; Legend. Follow the Legend Wizard. Make sure all layers of interest are included in the legend. If you right click on a layer name and rename the layer, the name also gets changed in the legend. You can double click on the legend to edit properties. Since the legend is generated using layer names, you might want to change the name of a layer so that appropriate text appears in the legend. Also, make sure to include units on any numeric values that appear in the legend. This can be done either in the header (e.g., Elevation (m) or after each number (e.g. 910 m). Make these changes in the Table of Contents by slowly clicking the layer title or color bar label twice to change the text.

8.Go to Insert &#8594; North Arrow. Select a north arrow. 

9.Go to Insert &#8594; Bar. Select a scale bar. Double click on the scale bar to modify it. On the Scale and Units tab, set Division Units to Kilometers. 

10.Arrange the Title, Legend, North Arrow, and Scale Bar appropriately on the page.

11.Some things to consider when creating your map: 

-- Will you be printing/displaying in color or black and white? If printing in black and white, it’s better to prepare the map in black 
and white rather than rely on the printer to convert your color choices to grey scale. 

--	If using color, be aware that certain colors have natural or cultural associations. For example, blue typically indicates water whereas red indicates hot or danger. If you are making a map of precipitation in color, try using darker blue for more precipitation and lighter blue for less. 
-- Make sure the text is large enough but not overwhelming for the print or display you intend to use.
-- Include units

12.Go to File &#8594; Export Map. Choose a Save as type (e.g., BMP, JPEG, PDF). Click Save.
